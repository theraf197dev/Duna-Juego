# Pacman like game

This is a project created with React, to improve my skills and test myself making a web game similar to pacman.

The game has 2 different modes:


## Trial

In this mode the player just needs to collect all the pizzas within the time given.
Incresing the difficulty will make rocks spawn in order to restrict player moves a bit.

## Seeker

This mode was inspired by the daxter minigame in Jak3 ([Eco grid game](https://jakanddaxter.fandom.com/wiki/Eco_grid_game)).
Like the previos mode the player needs to collect all the pizzas but instead of a timer, an enemy called seeker will spawn and if he touches the player will be game over.
Likewise before incresing the difficulty will make rocks spawn in order to restrict player moves a bit. but it also restrict seekers movements too.

Hope everyone who plays my game enjoys it :)


### PD: This is open source so you can use it to make your own games or whatever you want. For example, you can easily change the `board size`, `seekers speed` and `timer` in trial mode with just changing one constant in `src/common/fixtures.js file`.
